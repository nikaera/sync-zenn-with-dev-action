# Just sync Zenn articles to DEV üßò

It can be used to sync articles written in [Zenn](https://zenn.dev/) to [DEV](http://dev.to/).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

The minimum usage is as follows.

```yml
name: 'Sync all Zenn articles to DEV'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: checkout my project
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: dev.to action step
        uses: nikaera/sync-zenn-with-dev-action@v1.2.0
        id: dev-to
        with:
          # DEV API key will be required.
          api_key: ${{ secrets.api_key }}
          # (optional) Your account name in Zenn (Fields to be filled in if canonical url is set.)
          # username: nikaera
          # (optional) Synchronize only the articles in the file path divided by line breaks.
          # added_modified_filepath: ./added_modified.txt
          # (optional) Whether to sync all articles. `update_all` takes precedence over `added_modified_filepath`.
          # update_all: false
          # (optional) Specify the DEV article title format. {title} is required. {type} and {emoji} are not required.
          # title_format: "[{type}] {title} {emoji}"
        # If there is a new article to be synced to DEV,
        # the ID of the DEV article will be assigned to the markdown header of the Zenn article.
        # (This is used to determine whether the article will be newly created or updated next time.)
      - name: write article id of DEV to articles of Zenn.
        run: |
          git config user.name github-actions
          git config user.email github-actions@github.com
          git add ${{ steps.dev-to.outputs.newly-sync-articles }}
          git commit -m "sync: Zenn with DEV [skip ci]"
          git push
        if: steps.dev-to.outputs.newly-sync-articles
        # Output the title and URL of the article synced to DEV.
      - name: Get the output articles.
        run: echo "${{ steps.dev-to.outputs.articles }}"
```

## üé¨ Scenario

Initially, I recommend running the following GitHub Action to sync all your articles to DEV.
https://github.com/nikaera/zenn.dev/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-zenn-with-dev-action-all.yml

After that, you can use the following GitHub Action to synchronize the article as soon as there are changes in the article file.
https://github.com/nikaera/zenn.dev/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-zenn-with-dev.yml

## üõ†Ô∏è Customizing

### Inputs

| key | description | required |
|:---|:---|:---:|
|api_key| The [API Key](https://docs.forem.com/api/#section/Authentication) required to use the DEV API | true |
|username | **Your account name** in Zenn (Fields to be filled in if canonical url is set.)  | false |
|added_modified_filepath | Synchronize only the articles in the file path divided by line breaks. You can use [jitterbit/get-changed-files@v1](https://github.com/jitterbit/get-changed-files) to get only the file paths of articles that have changed in the correct format. | false |
|update_all| Whether to sync all articles. **`update_all` takes precedence over `added_modified_filepath`**. | true |
|title_format| Specify the DEV article title format. **`{title}` is required. `{type}` and `{emoji}` are not required.** (ex. `"[{type}] {title} {emoji}"`) | false |

### Outputs

| key | description |
|:---|:---|
| articles | A list of URLs of dev.to articles that have been created or updated |
| newly-sync-articles | File path list of newly synchronized articles. **Make sure to commit the list of articles set to this value, as they will be updated.** See [action.yml](https://github.com/nikaera/sync-zenn-with-dev-action/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml#L31-L38) |

## üìù Notes

- [DEV only allows 4 tags](https://dev.to/p/editor_guide#front-matter), so if an article has more than 4 tags, the first 4 tags will be set in the article.
